Hello Martin,

Just thought I would write this to make sure you are able to run the code.  

The file is in the FigShare link.  https://figshare.com/s/7feee42f7896a797e247

To make sure the code works, you will need to download the CSV file from Figshare and place it into your desktop.  
the code is written to find it into the desktop.

Run the code, you may get a Red Message bar saying "Mixed Types....".  Please ignore this, the code should work just fine without it.

You must enter the name of the gene EXACTLY as it is written, or else it will say it is not in the INDEX.

Best of Luck,
-Zachary Knotts
