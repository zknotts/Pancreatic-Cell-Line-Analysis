Hello Martin,

Just thought I would write this to make sure you are able to run the code.  

The file is in the FigShare link.  https://figshare.com/s/7feee42f7896a797e247

1) To make sure the code works, you will need to download the CSV file from Figshare.
2) and place it into your desktop.  On line 6 of the code is where the file is located, please check to see if the location is correct
YOU WILL HAVE TO CHANGE THE CODE ON LINE 6 TO LOCATE WHEREVER YOU PUT THE CSV

Run the code, you may get a Red Message bar saying "Columns have Mixed Types....".  Please ignore this, the code should work just fine 
without it.

3) You must enter the name of the gene EXACTLY as it is written, or else it will say it is not in the INDEX.

4) Run either Geneanalysis() or Multigene()

Best of Luck,
-Zachary Knotts
